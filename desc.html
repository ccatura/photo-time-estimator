<div class="title">Photo Time Estimator</div>
<div class="desc">Photo Time Estimator is basically a focused calculator. At my photography job I need to give estimates on how long certain amounts of product take to get shot. It gives a rough estimate, rounding up to the nearest next unit (hours, days, weeks). It also includes a 'defaults-maker' to enter default times, or you can override that and enter your own times.</div>
